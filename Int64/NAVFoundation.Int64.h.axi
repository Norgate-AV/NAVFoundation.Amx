/**
 * @file NAVFoundation.Int64.h.axi
 * @brief Header file defining Int64 structure and constants.
 *
 * This header defines the _NAVInt64 structure used to represent 64-bit integers
 * as a pair of 32-bit values (high and low). The structure and operations have
 * been optimized for use in cryptographic operations like SHA-512.
 *
 * IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
 * - The _NAVInt64 structure uses Hi and Lo 32-bit parts to represent a 64-bit value
 * - Some operations have precision limitations documented in the implementation file
 * - This library is primarily intended for use in the SHA-512 implementation
